#
# Everything runs against a throwaway KM_STATE_DIR, so the real town's mail
# and seat state are never touched, and nothing here needs tmux, claude, bd,
# or a running dispatcher. What is pinned is the machinery the society stands
# on: the config reader, seat identity, mail delivery (single, broadcast, and
# the read/unread move), wake queueing, and the halt flag — plus the refusals,
# because a mail system that misdelivers silently or a wake that invents a
# seat is how the ledger starts lying.

# Run via: just test-hooks
